    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input. It helps us evaluate the efficiency and scalability of an algorithm, making it more efficient.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> on the other hand, measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of the input. For example, if a program takes an array of size n as input, the space complexity of the program becomes O(n).</p>
