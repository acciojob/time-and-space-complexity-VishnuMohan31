	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input. It helps us evaluate the efficiency and scalability of an algorithm.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> on the other hand, measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of the input.</p>
