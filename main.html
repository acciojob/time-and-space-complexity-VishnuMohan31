	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity is understood as the time taken by a program to run and complete the given task. As a programmer, your goal is to reduce the time complexity of the code by optimizzing it and make it more efficient.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b>on the other hand, measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of the input.</p>
